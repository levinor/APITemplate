# APITemplate
Wellcome to my API Template/Playground/Portfolio. The idea is to create some sort of API to test ideasand have them as example for later use. Of course I'll use latest versi√≥n of .NET Core and, maybe, .NET 5 when it's finally released.

## API characteristics
- MVC Schema: Three layers Controller, Services and Repositories.
- Data Models for every layer.
- KISS Principle make everything as simple as posible.
- Dependency Injection. Of course.
- EF Code First.

## Ideas to develop
- Unit Testing: With Moked data.
- Multi DataBase: The idea is to have at least one SQL Data Source and a NonSQL Data Source.
    - SQL DataBase.
        - Hosted in Azure.
        - Both strongly typed and non typed models.
        - Full package: Tables, SP and Views.
    - NoN SQL Database
        - Use some DynamoDB like DB but in Azure
- Cache
- Token system to check permisions 
- CORS
- SWAGGER
- HTTP connections to other APIs
- WS-SOAP connections (If I can find a free usable WS-SOAP)
