# APITemplate
Wellcome to my API Template/Playground/Portfolio. The idea is to create some sort of API to test ideasand have them as example for later use. Of course I'll use latest versi√≥n of .NET Core and, maybe, .NET 5 when it's finally released.

## API current characteristics
- MVC Schema: Three layers Controller, Services and Repositories.
- Data Models for every layer.
- KISS Principle make everything as simple as posible.
- Dependency Injection. Of course.
- EF Code First (For now only in SQL)
- SWAGGER

## Ideas to develop
- Unit Testing: With Moked data.
- Multi DataBase: The idea is to have at least one SQL Data Source and a NonSQL Data Source.
    - SQL DataBase.
    - NoN SQL Database
- Cache
- Token system to check permisions 
- CORS
- HTTP connections to other APIs
- WS-SOAP connections (If I can find a free usable WS-SOAP)
